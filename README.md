**General Info:**

An app to change the default Blender theme colors with some added options.


**NOTE!:**

Because this program was built with PyInstaller, Some "Premium" antivirus software may think it's a virus or the file is suspicious;
Thats why this program is on Github, If you really dont trust the program then just get the .py file from the source code, and scan the code inside the file.


**Setup:**

Its a .exe file c'mon dude...


**Running:**

1- in Blender, Make a new Theme in the Theme Settings in preferences.


2- in the program press The "Preset File" Option, This option will take you to a folder in your appdata that has all the available Blender versions on your computer,
if it didn't then you can go to this directary "C:\Users\[YOUR USER NAME]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\" and then pick the Blender version you used earlier
to make the theme, then go Scripts -> Presets -> Interface_Theme and pick the XML file with the name you choose.

3- Then you have the option "Shade", turning this on will make all of Blender UI shaded like the image above.
